This is a temporary name/repository to confirm we can all build the project. Once we're setup we can create a shared repository elsewhere if necessary.

For the moment you will need to build the prject locally in order to play, but later on we can compile and add downloadable releases to this repository.

#### Building the project

Make sure you have the matching Unreak Engine version installed, you should then be able to open the project.

#### Contributing to the project

If you ar efamiliar with Git, feel free to submit PRs with any changes or addition. If not, someone in the channel should be able to show you how to get started. Finally, feel free to simply share assets ect in the channel if that;s preferred.
